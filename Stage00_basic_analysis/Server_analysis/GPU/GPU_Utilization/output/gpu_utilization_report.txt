UTILIZATION EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS
-------------------------------

Time in Low Utilization State (<20%): 100.00%
Time in Medium Utilization State (20-49%): 0.00%
Time in High Utilization State (50-79%): 0.00%
Time in Very High Utilization State (≥80%): 0.00%

RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------

1. Overall GPU utilization is low, suggesting GPUs are often idle. Consider consolidating workloads onto fewer GPUs or implementing an auto-scaling solution to optimize resource usage.
4. The following groups show consistently low utilization and may benefit from workload consolidation: GPU1, GPU2, GPU3.

NOTES:
- This report analyzes the utilization of GPUs across the server groups.
- Optimal GPU utilization typically falls between 50-80%. Too low suggests wasted resources, while too high can lead to performance bottlenecks.
- Consider comparing utilization with actual job completion times to assess true efficiency.
- For better resource allocation, consider implementing dynamic scheduling of GPU workloads based on the patterns identified in this report.
