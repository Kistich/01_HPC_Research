RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------

1. Overall GPU power draw is moderate. Continue monitoring, but current levels appear to be within expected operational range.
2. Significant power imbalance between server groups. GPU1 is drawing substantially more power than GPU3, which may lead to cooling and performance variations.
5. Large variations in power draw detected. This may indicate unstable workloads or power management issues. Consider implementing more consistent workload scheduling.

NOTES:
- This report analyzes the power draw of GPUs across the server groups.
- Power efficiency can be improved by utilizing GPU processing capacity more consistently rather than in bursts.
- Consider comparing power draw with actual computational output to assess true efficiency.
- Modern GPUs generally operate most efficiently at moderate to high utilization levels with consistent workloads.
