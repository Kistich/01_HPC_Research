==================================================

Executive Summary
--------------------
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of GPU performance metrics across multiple server groups.
The analysis covers the following metrics:
- GPU Utilization (%)
- Memory Utilization (%)
- Graphics Clock Speed (MHz)
- Memory Clock Speed (MHz)
- SM Clock Speed (MHz)
- Video Clock Speed (MHz)
- Power Draw (W)
- Memory Allocation (MB)
- Average GPU Utilization (%)

Key Findings by Metric
--------------------

GPU Utilization:
  - GPU utilization patterns can indicate workload distribution effectiveness.
  - Consistently high utilization may indicate potential bottlenecks.
  - Low utilization suggests potential for workload consolidation.

Memory Utilization:
  - Memory utilization shows how effectively GPU memory is being used.
  - High memory utilization may indicate potential memory bottlenecks.
  - Optimal memory utilization depends on workload characteristics.

Clock Speeds:
  - Clock speeds provide insights into GPU performance capabilities.
  - Lower than expected clock speeds may indicate thermal throttling.
  - Clock speed variations can impact workload performance consistency.

Power Draw:
  - Power consumption directly impacts operational costs.
  - High power draw during low utilization periods indicates inefficiency.
  - Power patterns can reveal opportunities for workload scheduling optimization.

Memory Allocation:
  - Memory allocation shows how applications request GPU memory.
  - High allocations with low utilization may indicate memory leaks or inefficient code.
  - Memory allocation patterns can guide application optimization efforts.

Cross-Metric Analysis:
  - Correlation between utilization and power draw can identify efficiency opportunities.
  - Relationship between clock speeds and utilization reveals throttling behavior.
  - Memory utilization vs. allocation patterns indicate memory management efficiency.

Recommendations
--------------------
1. Monitor servers with consistently high GPU or memory utilization for potential bottlenecks.
2. Consider workload consolidation for server groups with consistently low utilization.
3. Investigate power optimization opportunities, especially during low-utilization periods.
4. Analyze workload scheduling to better distribute resource demand across time.
5. Compare GPU performance metrics with application SLAs to ensure resource allocation aligns with needs.

Methodology
--------------------
This analysis was performed using data extracted from GPU metric logs. The following analytical methods were applied:
- Time-series analysis of utilization patterns (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Statistical analysis of metric distributions
- Threshold-based identification of high-utilization periods
- Heatmap visualization of metric patterns by time of day and day of week
- Group-based comparison of performance across server categories

Conclusion
--------------------
This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights into GPU performance patterns across the server infrastructure.
The findings can guide infrastructure optimization, workload scheduling, and resource allocation decisions.
Regular monitoring of these metrics can help maintain optimal performance and efficiency over time.
